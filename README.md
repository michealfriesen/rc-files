# rc-files

This is my personal repository for rc files and other configuration files so I can set up my environment on any machine. 

### Current Setup: 
Vim with some core settings and important vundle plugins like You Complete Me and NERDTree. 

First install vundle then run :PluginInstall


I am also using tmux which is a nice terminal multiplexer. It allows for easier window managment when sshing. It also provides session management.
